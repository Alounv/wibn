# Dispo

Dispo or Wibn (for Wouldn't It Be Nice) is an app that allow to find common free slot in users calendars.
It can be tested here: https://dispo.fly.dev/.

## What

1. You login with Google and connect your agenda (only free / busy slots)
2. You create a group with other users.
3. On a regular basis, the app scans the group members calendar and choose the best time to meet.
4. Then it sends an email to everyone
